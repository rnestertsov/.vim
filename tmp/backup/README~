Storage:
- column file organized in blocks 64KB each
- First: the last value of each block is stored in the index: this allow quickly find block with given value. After block has been found binary search is applied to find
  directly
- Second: for all columns a sparce index is created on position (which is also touple id. Again, the last position of each block is stored in the index.
  This is usefull for operations the needs to find a given value for a specific touple ID.

Query execution:
>> SELECT shipdate, linenum FROM lineitem
>> WHERE shipdate < CONST1 AND linenum < CONST2

We use operator DS1 (DataSource) which is responsible for reading columns from disk and performing filtering based on predicates. The
output of the operator are a list of positions(touple ids) of values that passed given predicate.
